This code defines classes for binary trees and implements various tree traversal methods along with 
tree manipulation operations like adding, deleting, and replacing nodes. 
Additionally, it generates a random binary tree and performs traversals on it, 
including inorder, preorder, and postorder. It also calculates the number of levels in the generated binary tree and counts nodes with only one child.
